main.py - contains my first draft, saved the first two sections of the code as I thought that these worked out but needed to fine tune the rest and didn't want to loose my way. 

v2.py - I was hoping would be the final version, however I'm unsure whether it's a combination of the functions (I still don't think I fully understand the ordering of them) or it's the 'strong' variable, which I've moved around the code to various places but it's either returning a 'not defined' error or a recurring loop of 'your password is not suitable'

v3.py - I wondered whether my lack of confidence in my understanding of functions was causing the issue, so I removed them all together, which has lead me to think that they way I am validating the content of the password is the issue. 

In short, I'm stuck!
